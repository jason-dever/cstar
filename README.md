This is a summer research project mostly in inverse semigroups, with special attention 
dedicated to the graph inverse semigroup. In particular, I provide a general description
of the tight spectrum, the Exel spectrum, and the set of ultrafilters on the graph inverse 
semigroup. The intention behind this project is to cap off my first year as an undergrad at 
Carleton University; I'd like to purse research in my academic career, and this hopes to be 
a step in that direction.
