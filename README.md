# C*-Algebras
This is a summer research project in graph C*-algebras. 
The intention behind this project is to cap off my first year as an undergraduate student at Carleton University, and set myself on the path 
of academic research. Thank you to Dr. Charles Starling and the Nigerian Prince for making this possible.
