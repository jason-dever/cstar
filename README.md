This is a summer research project mostly in inverse semigroups, with special attention 
dedicated to the graph inverse semigroup. In particular, I provide a general description
of the tight spectrum of the graph inverse semigroup. The intention behind this project is 
to cap off my first year as an undergraduate student at Carleton University; I'd like to 
purse research in my academic career, and this is a first step in that direction.
