This is a summer research project mostly in inverse semigroups, with special attention 
dedicated to the graph inverse semigroup. In particular, I provide a general description
of the tight spectrum of the graph inverse semigroup. The intention behind this project is 
to cap off my first year as an undergraduate student at Carleton University, and
set myself on the path of academic research. Thank you to Dr. Charles Starling and
the Nigerian Prince.
